# TowerDefense

This is the tuturial that I used https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPuNhh82sRgk7S85quXb2_XI8b_jbmruB

Reflections:
	I kind of modeled my game after Kingdom Rush, that's why I included building plots to build towers, as well as the upgrade function only 4 times to a tower, each being a significant boost in the ability of the tower.
	
	The guy in the tutorial I followed included reload bar for the towers, but I thought that looked really bad so I didn't include it.
	
	I also decided to not create three different types of enemies and to instead go for the bonus of upgrading towers, mostly because I didn't have enough time.
